## **Smart Warehouse Simulation**

This project simulates a **smart warehouse system** that replicates real-world loading and unloading workflows using **barcode scanning**. It provides real-time tracking of warehouse activities and offers interactive visualizations of inventory data through **Metabase** dashboards and **Chart.js** charts.

### **Key Features**

* **Barcode Scanning Simulation** – Mimics real-time product scans for both loading and unloading operations.
* **Activity Tracking** – Logs all warehouse movements with timestamps for process monitoring.
* **Inventory Data Visualization** – Uses **Chart.js** for interactive dashboards and **Metabase** for advanced analytics.
* **Dataset-Driven Simulation** – Runs on free mock datasets that represent realistic warehouse inventory flows.
